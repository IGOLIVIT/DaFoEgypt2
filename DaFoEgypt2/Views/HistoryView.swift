The pyramids were not merely tombs but cosmic machines designed to launch the pharaoh's soul into the afterlife. Thousands of workers (not slaves!) labored voluntarily, housed and fed by the state. The Great Sphinx of Giza was carved during this era, and the solar boat of Khufu was buried beside his pyramid to carry him across the heavens.",

This era produced magnificent literature including 'The Tale of Sinuhe' and 'The Eloquent Peasant.' Trade expanded southward into Nubia and eastward to Punt (modern Somalia).

Thutmose III conquered lands in 17 military campaigns, creating an empire. Akhenaten revolutionized religion with monotheism. Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered intact in 1922, revealed the splendor of royal burials. Ramesses II built Abu Simbel and fought the Hittites at Kadesh, the first battle recorded in detail.",

The Saite pharaohs (26th Dynasty) from the city of Sais led a cultural renaissance, deliberately imitating Old Kingdom art and architecture. Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt in 525 BCE.

Alexandria's Great Library contained 400,000 scrolls, and the Pharos Lighthouse was one of the Seven Wonders. Cleopatra VII, the last pharaoh, allied with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony.

Bread and beer were dietary staples. The wealthy enjoyed banquets with music and dancing. Medicine was advanced - doctors performed surgeries and prescribed remedies.

            extendedDescription: "The word 'hieroglyphics' means 'sacred carvings.' This writing system was used for 3,500 years, appearing on temple walls, papyrus scrolls, and tomb inscriptions. Scribes also used hieratic (cursive hieroglyphics) for daily documents and later demotic for everyday writing. The script was deciphered in 1822 by Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion using the Rosetta Stone, which displayed the same text in hieroglyphics, demotic, and Greek.",

            description: "Mummification was a 70-day process to preserve the body for the afterlife. Organs were removed and stored in canopic jars. The body was dried with natron salt, wrapped in linen, and placed in decorated coffins.",
            extendedDescription: "Egyptians believed the soul needed a preserved body to exist in the afterlife. During mummification, embalmers removed all organs except the heart (seat of intelligence). The brain was extracted through the nose and discarded. The body was covered in natron for 40 days to dry it out, then wrapped in hundreds of meters of linen with amulets placed between layers. Priests recited spells during the process. The wealthy received elaborate mummification, while commoners were buried more simply in the desert sand.",
